changes: 
  - tweak: "The stechkin pistol is now a makarov. It comes chambered in 9mm. Nothing has really changed for performance or ammo availability. It's just all in 9mm now."
  - tweak: "The stechkin APS is now normal sized and available to nukies for 10 tc. It sprays bullets like mad and fires very quickly."
  - tweak: "The caravan now has stechkin APS magazines."
  - tweak: "The Spetznaz bundle uses incendiary magazines for the APS."
  - balance: ".45 is stronger across the board by about 5 damage, and has more bullet variety."
  - balance: "the c20-r is a 3 burst weapon and costs 13tc."
  - balance: "5.56mm now has 30 armor penetration and has some bullet spread.. This only affects the m90gl and the Boarder assault rifles."
  - tweak: "You can buy phasic ammo for the m90 for 8 tc out of the uplink. It passes through walls and objects, and does significantly less damage. (comparatively speaking of course)"
  - tweak: "X-Ray beams now pass through doors, machinery, and structures like lockers."
